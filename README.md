# Cross site scripting (XSS) using deep learning.

* This model will generate noble automatic xss payloads after learning from previous xss payloads. This model is 93.3% accurate. Sometime user have to make effort to complete the incomplete payload. 

## Requirements
* Installation instruction
   
   ```bash
   install conda-mini python 2.7
   pip install tesorflow==1.0
   python2 train.py
   python2 sample.py
   ```


## XSS payloads as datasets


## Tensorboard
* To navigate tensorboartd:
  
   ```bash
   $ tensorboard --logdir=./logs/
   ```
